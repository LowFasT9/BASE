# Voice_Assistant Project

Created voice_assistant similar to Alexa which takes user voice command and performs the given function. Has a simple GUI using pyqt5, implemented speech_recognition and pywhatkit to get information from Wikipedia and connected to youtube incase of song requests from users. 

Below is a simple implementation video of the project.
